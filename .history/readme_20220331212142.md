### Editable NN
This section contains the pilot works that might contributes to the prevalence of prompt learning paradigm.
1. **Editable Neural Networks** ICLR 2020. ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Editable_training-DCE7F1) 

   *Anton Sinitsin, Vsevolod Plokhotnyuk, Dmitriy Pyrkin, Sergei Popov, Artem Babenko*.  [[pdf](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJedXaEtvS)], [[project](https://github.com/xtinkt/editable)],  2020.7

   Related work:
   - re-train on the original dataset augmented with new samples (expensive)
   - use a manual cache (e.g. lookup table) that overrules model predictions on problematic samples (can't generalize to semantic equivalent inputs)
   Method:
   Editable Training (employ meta-learning techniques to ensure that mistakes can be corrected without harming its overall performance)

1. **Fact-based Text Editing** ACL 2020. ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fact_based_text_editing-DCE7F1) 
   
   *Hayate Iso, Chao Qiao, Hang Li*.  [[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.17.pdf)], [[project](https://github.com/isomap/factedit)],  2020.7

   Main cons.:
   - propose a new dataset (task): transforms a draft text into a revised text based on given triples
   - new model, FACTEDITOR. The model consists of three components, a buffer for storing the draft text and its representations, a stream for storing the revised text and its representations, and a memory for storing the triples and their representations
